# Royals-V2

## TODO
- [x] Refactor Package more appropriately - there should be a "botting" library and a "royals" implementation.
  - [ ] Re-test Minimap (DONE!), Chat Feed (DONE), and fix Logs from discord/asyncio (TODO)
- [ ] When done, update all docstrings as some are lacking now.
- [ ] Minimap pathing - algorithm to find paths between point A and B based on minimap
- [ ] Automated handle and IGN associated + retrieval
- [ ] Enable np arrays/.png files to be sent through Pipe - then send chat images towards discord
- [ ] GPT Automated Responses
- [ ] Refactor game interface more accurately
- [ ] Common actions

## Nice to have
  - [ ] Chat - Try additional pre-processing: Thresholding (improved?), Denoising (application of Gaussian and/or Median Blur), Contrast Enhancement (Make text more distinguishable from background)
  - [ ] Chat - Pre-trained model for semantic segmentation? Could help distinguish text from the rest.
  - [ ] Chat - Other OCR libraries? OCRopus & EasyOCR in particular.
  - [ ] Chat - Otherwise, build a modelling dataset with tons of chat lines and train a model to read text.
  - [ ] Object Detection Modelling - For Characters (Generally), My characters (if required), Mobs (1 model per mob)
