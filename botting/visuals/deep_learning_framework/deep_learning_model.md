You can download pre-trained YOLO models from the official YOLO website or GitHub repositories. Here are some common sources:

1. **YOLOv3**: [YOLOv3 Weights](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
2. **YOLOv4**: [YOLOv4 Weights](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)
3. **YOLOv5**: [YOLOv5 GitHub](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
4. **YOLOv8 (latest)**: [YOLOv8 GitHub](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics?tab=readme-ov-file)

### Pre-trained Model Usage
Pre-trained YOLO models are trained on the COCO dataset, which includes a wide variety of common objects. While it may not directly detect your specific game characters, it can still be useful for general object detection tasks.

### Custom Training
To train YOLO specifically for your game characters, you need to create a custom dataset and follow these steps:

1. **Collect Data**: Gather images of your game characters in various states and environments. Use this script to collect images from a running game: [Game Image Collector](data_collector.py)
2. **Annotate Data**: Use annotation tools like LabelImg to label the bounding boxes around your characters. Several tools exist for this purpose, such as:
   - [Roboflow Annotate](https://roboflow.com/annotate) (Definitely the best, but images are stored on their servers and made public)
   - [CVAT](https://cvat.ai/) (Next best option Computer Vision Annotation Tool)
   - [Labelme](https://github.com/labelmeai/labelme)
3. **Prepare Dataset**: Organize your dataset in the required format (images and corresponding annotation files).
4. **Train YOLO**: Use a YOLO training framework to train the model on your custom dataset.

### Example: Training YOLOv8 on Custom Dataset

1. **Install YOLOv8**:
    ```bash
    pip install ultralytics
    ```

2. **Prepare Dataset**:
    - Organize your dataset in the following structure:
      ```
      dataset/
      ├── train/
      │   ├── images/
      │   ├── labels/
      ├── test/
      │   ├── images/
      │   ├── labels/
      ├── vaild/
      │   ├── images/
      │   ├── labels/
      ```

3. **Create YAML Configuration**:
    - Create a YAML file (`custom_dataset.yaml`) to specify the dataset paths and class names.
    ```yaml
    train: /path/to/dataset/images/train
    val: /path/to/dataset/images/val
    test: /path/to/dataset/images/test

    nc: 1  # number of classes
    names: ['character']  # class names
    ```

4. **Train the Model**:
    [Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/)

This command will start training the YOLOv8 model on your custom dataset. Adjust the parameters (`img`, `batch`, `epochs`, etc.) as needed.

### Summary
- **Download pre-trained YOLO models** from official sources.
- **Use pre-trained models** for general object detection.
- **Train YOLO on custom datasets** for specific game character detection by collecting and annotating data, preparing the dataset, and training the model using a YOLO framework.
